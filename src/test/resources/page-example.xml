'''Campinas''' ({{IPA-pt|kɐ̃ˈpinɐs}}, ''Plains'' or ''Meadows''&lt;ref&gt;http://campinasss.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/etymology.html&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo State]], part of the country's [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]]. According to the 2010 Census, the city's population is 1,080,999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Censo 2010: população do Brasil é de 190.732.694 pessoas |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=1766&amp;id_pagina=1 |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of cities in Brazil by population|fourteenth most populous Brazilian city]] and the [[São Paulo (state)|third most populous municipality in São Paulo state]]. The city's [[metropolitan area]], [[Metropolitan Region of Campinas]], contains twenty municipalities with a total population of 2,976,433 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agemcamp.sp.gov.br/rmc/ Região Metropolitana de Campinas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is home to the [[Unicamp|University of Campinas]], one of the most prestigious in Latin America.

==Etymology==
Campinas means ''grass fields'' in Portuguese and refers to its characteristic landscape, which originally comprised large stretches of dense subtropical forests (mato grosso or thick woods in Portuguese), mainly along the many rivers, interspersed with gently rolling hills covered by low-lying vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;''ibidem'' http://campinasss.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/etymology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Campinas' official crest and flag has a picture of the mythical bird, the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], because it was practically reborn after a devastating [[epidemic]] of [[yellow fever]] in the 1800s, which killed more than 25% of the city's inhabitants.

==History==
[[File:Mapacampinas1878.png|thumb|left|Campinas in 1878]]
[[File:Mapa de Campinas de 1929.jpg|left|thumb|Maps of railways in Campinas in 1929]]

The city was founded on July 14, 1774, by Barreto Leme.&lt;ref name=&quot;foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Campinas faz 233 anos hoje | url=http://www.cpopular.com.br/mostra_noticia.asp?noticia=1520595&amp;area=2140&amp;authent=8999D8D6264332BCDBED94130107FE | accessdate =2009-01-06| date =2007-07-14| publisher=[[Correio Popular]] |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially a simple outpost on the way to [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Goiás]] serving the &quot;[[Bandeirantes]]&quot; who were in search of precious minerals and [[Indigenous people of Brazil|Indian]] [[slavery|slaves]]. In the first half of the 19th century, Campinas became a growing population center, with many [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[sugarcane]] [[farm]]s.

The construction of a [[railway]] linking the city of [[São Paulo]] to [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]]' seaport, in 1867, was very important for its growth. In the second half of the 19th century, with the abolition of [[Slavery in Brazil|slavery]], farming and [[industrialization]] attracted many foreign [[immigration|immigrants]] to replace the lost manpower, mainly from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internations.org/campinas-expats/italians Italians in Campinas&lt;/ref&gt;

Coffee became an important export and the city became wealthy. In consequence, a large service sector was established to serve the growing population, and in the first decades of the 20th century, Campinas could already boast of an [[opera house]], theaters, banks, movie theaters, radio stations, a [[orchestra|philharmonic]] orchestra, two newspapers (''[[Correio Popular]]'' and ''[[Diário do Povo (Campinas)|Diário do Povo]]''), a good public education system (with the Escola Normal de Campinas and the [[Colégio Culto à Ciência]]), and hospitals, such as the Santa Casa de Misericórdia (a [[Charitable organization|charity]] for poor people).

And the Casa de Saúde de Campinas (for the Italian community, formerly known as ''Circolo Italiani Uniti''), and the most important Brazilian research center in agricultural sciences, the [[Instituto Agronômico de Campinas]], which was founded by Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. Finally, the construction of the first Brazilian highway in 1938, between Campinas and São Paulo, the [[Anhanguera Highway]], was a turning point in the integration of Campinas into the rest of the state.

Campinas was the birthplace of opera composer [[Antônio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gounin.net/ACGUS/acgbious.htm Carlos Gomes Biography&lt;/ref&gt; (1836&amp;nbsp;— 1896) and of the President of the Republic [[Manoel Ferraz de Campos Salles|Campos Salles]] (1841&amp;nbsp;— 1913).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayrtonmarcondes.com.br/blog/?page_id=307 Campos Salles&lt;/ref&gt; It was home for 49 years to [[Hércules Florence]], reputed as one of the early inventors of [[photography]], [[photocopying]] and the [[mimeograph]].&lt;ref&gt;http://latin.discovery.com/features/000914langsdorff/langsdorffhome.html Hercules Florence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Cambuí - Porsche amarelo em frente ao Regatas 002.jpg|thumb|right|Regatas Club in Cambuí neighborhood.]]
The area of the city, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, is 795.697&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 238.3230&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of this is the urban area and 557.334&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; remaining constitute greater Campinas.  It is located at 22°54′21″S, 47°03′39″W and is at a distance of 96 kilometers northwest of São Paulo. Its neighboring cities are Paulínia, Jaguariúna and Pedreira, north; Morungaba, Itatiba and Valinhos in the east; Itupeva, Indaiatuba and Monte Mor, south, and Hortolândia in the west.

===Ecology===
Most of the original vegetation of the city was devastated. Like 13 other municipalities in the metropolitan region of Campinas, the city is subject to severe environmental stress, and Campinas is considered one of the areas liable to flooding and silting; it now has less than 5% of [[vegetation]] cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolsenz.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.dolsenz.com/campinas/ Vegetation - Campinas {{en icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

To try to reverse this situation, several projects have been and are being conducted and planned, such as building corridors, such as regulation of the Management Plan of Environmental Preservation Area (APA) in Campinas. There are also several environmental projects to combat the destruction of riparian forests located on the river london, which has a high level of pollution. Today, Campinas houses the Area of Relevant Ecological Interest (ARIE) Santa Geneva, {{convert|251|acre|km2}}, established in 1985 and regulated by the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), the city of Campinas, Fundação José Pedro de Oliveira. This is the now second largest urban forest of Brazil, behind only the [[Tijuca Forest]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dolsenz.com&quot;/&gt;

The city also has large [[forest]]s, such as Jequitibás Wood (installed in 1881), Forest Grove and the Germans of Guarantees.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolsenz.com&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Lightning in Campinas (see more photos on comments) (2167011677).jpg|thumb|right|View of Campinas during a [[storm]].]]
The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] but mitigated by elevation (Köppen type ''Cwa''), with lower rainfall in winter and an annual average temperature of 21.3&amp;nbsp;°C. Winters are generally dry and mild (rarely too cold), and summers rainy with warm to hot temperatures. The warmest month is February, with an average temperature of 24&amp;nbsp;°C, an average maximum of 29.1&amp;nbsp;°C and average minimum of 19.0&amp;nbsp;°C. The coldest month, July, sees respective temperatures of 17.8&amp;nbsp;°C, and 24.2&amp;nbsp;°C and 11.4&amp;nbsp;°C average maximum and minimum. Fall and spring are transitional seasons.

The average annual rainfall is 1424.5&amp;nbsp;mm and the driest month in August, when there is only 22.9&amp;nbsp;mm. In January, the rainiest month, the average is 280.3&amp;nbsp;mm. In recent years, however, the hot, dry days during the winter have been increasingly frequent, often surpassing 30&amp;nbsp;°C, especially between July and September. In August 2010, for example, the rainfall in Campinas was only 0&amp;nbsp;mm. During the dry season and long dry spells in the middle of the rainy season are also common records of fires in the hills and thickets, especially in rural areas of the city, which contributes to deforestation and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, further worsening air quality.
The lowest temperature recorded in the city was −1.5&amp;nbsp;°C on June 25, 1918. The highest temperature was 39.0&amp;nbsp;°C, observed on 17 November 1985. The highest cumulative rainfall recorded in 24 hours in the city between June 1988 and October 2008 was 143.4&amp;nbsp;mm in 25 days May 2005. Between 1890 and 2004 there were 41 occurrences of frost in Campinas. The most recent was on July 18, 2000, when the minimum temperature reached 2.2&amp;nbsp;°C. There are also occasional episodes of strong winds, with gusts exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;km / h, and training records were made in the city day May 4, 2001 and March 9, 2008.

The wet season is from mid-October to mid-April, with heavier rains particularly in December, January, February and early March, and the dry season is from mid-May to mid-September. Average [[rainfall]] is 24.3&amp;nbsp;mm in August and 267.8&amp;nbsp;mm in January. Average [[humidity]] ranges from 37% (August) to 56% (January).

In the region around Campinas near the state of [[Minas Gerais]] there are a number of cities which enjoy an even milder mountain climate, such as [[Serra Negra]], [[Socorro, São Paulo|Socorro]], [[Lindóia]] and [[Águas de Lindóia]], where several water [[destination spa|spa]]s are located.

The presence of one of the largest [[oil refineries]] in Latin America ({{convert|350824|oilbbl|m3}} of [[Petroleum|crude]] per day), operated by [[Petrobras]] in the neighboring county of [[Paulínia]], has attracted many petrochemical companies to the Campinas area, including [[DuPont]], Rhone-Poulenc, and [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recap.com.br/ Petroleum in Campinas]&lt;/ref&gt;
